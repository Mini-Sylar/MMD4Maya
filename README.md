## Updated for Maya 2019 (BY MINI-SYLAR)
1. Updated for maya 2019 (since I really needed it) and should work with all version from (2018, 2019, 2020, 2022)
since they all use pyside2.
I can't test this since I have only 2019 installed...fingers crossed tho :)

2. Also, I don't think this user is active on his github so if he doesn't approve the pull request I will host it on my account
